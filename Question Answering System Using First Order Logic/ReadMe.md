This project is a *Question Answering System* on the domain "Groceries and Meat in a Supermarket". It takes as input the list of CNF(Conjunctive Normal Form)
axioms for assumption and a question. It returns the proof of a question that the system can answer.

Please note that you need **Prover9** to run this project!

For the entire framework of the project, please have a look at the report!

**Procedure to run this project:**

- Please copy paste all axioms from the file “CNF.doc” into Assumptions in Prover9.

- Write down your question specific assumptions too below it.

*Like, “Tomatoes(Roma)” is an assumption needed to ask the system question such as “Are Roma Tomatoes Red?”.*

-Question is placed in the Goals tab.
 
- Now, Simply, press Start and the Prover9 generates the proof.
